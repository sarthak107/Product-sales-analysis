# Sales Analysis Project

## Introduction

In today's digital age, every company engaged in online sales or maintaining an e-commerce website strives to maximize throughput to better understand and meet customer needs. This project involves detailed sales analysis, offering insights into product performance and areas for improvement. 

### What is Sales Analysis?

Sales Analysis is a critical evaluation of the sales performance of different products, providing insights into their market performance and profit contributions. It forms the basis for strategic decisions aimed at optimizing sales strategies and enhancing product appeal.

### Frequency of Sales Analysis

This project demonstrates how often sales analysis should be conducted, underlining its importance in providing competitive intelligence about sales strategies and team performance.

## Purpose of Analysis

The product analysis report is structured around three major facets:

1. **Internal Analysis:** Focuses on product improvement, tweaking, and marketing strategies from the business perspective.
2. **External Analysis:** Examines potential customer perceptions and strategies to convince them of the product's value over competitors.
3. **Cost Analysis:** Evaluates the end-to-end costs from manufacturing to sale, identifying potential cost-cutting opportunities without compromising quality.

## Things To Consider Before Doing a Sales Analysis

1. **Understanding the Business Model:** 
   - A business model outlines the plan for profit generation, identifying products, target markets, and anticipated expenses.

2. **Problem Analysis:** 
   - This involves understanding real-world problems and user needs, and proposing solutions. 
   - Suggestions for creating effective problem trees include involving stakeholders, conducting multiple exercises, aiming for simplicity, and recognizing the importance of the process.

3. **Consumer Usage Understanding:** 
   - Knowing how consumers will use your product is crucial in creating targeted features.

4. **Economic Impact:** 
   - Assessing the economic benefits of a project or the impact of discontinuing a product is vital.

5. **Data-Driven Decisions:** 
   - Understanding the types of decisions your data will drive is crucial for a data-driven decision-making process.
